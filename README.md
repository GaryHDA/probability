### Review and application of probability methods using python

This folder was orginally in the notes repo. However the study of probability and the implementation using python has become a focus of hammerdirt.

Like all of our work we start at the begining by reviewing past skills, developing our own implementation and comparing the output to the output from the standard python library.

### Usage:

This is to prepare a solid foundation for the implementation of libraires like scikit-learn, PyTorch and other AI librairies.

### Contributing:

Contributing is limited to hammerdirt members and associates. However if you see an error let us know, we will give you full credit in the notebook.
