### Probability

#### About this repo

This repo is part of the 2020-2021 beach litter surveillance project and part of the hammerdirt! infrastructure. Access is  public.

### Intended use

Applying different probability distributions and methods to survey data. Completed analysis projects are displayed on the hammerdirt! app and the appropriate client app. Anlysis is focussed on the probaility distribtuion of objects found at the regional level:

1. Indentifying appropriate distributions for data
2. Defining the PDF for each regional level and all data
3. Defining the PDF for key objects at regional levels
4. Using the probability distributions to explore/explain observed values
5. Understanding the relationship of independent variables and their effect on the PDF
6. Identifying relevant independent variables

### Data access

Access to data is provided through the Jupyter notebook templates.

### Contributing

2. Start a branch titled <yourname_abundance>
3. In the notebook make sure to change the "save_prefix" value
4. Complete your analysis 
5. On your local generate .html output of the notebook
6. Send the .html doc to roger@hammerdirt.ch

If your analysis makes sense and provides an innovative or original view of the subject we will request the following:
