    "### Starter template litter surveillance project (lsp) 20-21\n",
    "\n",
    "### This template is still under development. Expected completion date is  01-31-2020\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Intended use \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a standardized template for the lsp. It defines the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Directory structure \n",
    "2. File names\n",
    "3. Data access methods \n",
    "4. Formatting \n",
    "5. Required fields\n",
    "\n",
    "Contact hammerdirt if you plan on submitting your work for publication. We may be able to direct you to ressources or have some insight that could help.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How to save your version\n",
    "\n",
    "Save your files in the following format: lastname_firstname_x, where x is equal to the number of notebooks you have in the repo. See the examples below repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How to save charts, data, files \n",
    "\n",
    "Use the same prefix for all files, lastname_firstname_one_scatter.svg, or lastname_firstname_one.csv etc... \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Keep the subject per notebook limited \n",
    "\n",
    "Keep your notebooks focussed and limited in scope. Better to produce a couple of notebooks that build on each other than to create a big doc that is difficult to follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use utility files\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a folder called utility files. You can store your methods, just prefix them example: lastname_firstname_utility_one.py.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Don't lose time doing lengthy transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "If you find your self doing extensive itterations let us know how the data can be formatted on the server side to speed things up for you. Chances are if you need the results in a certain way others will too.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adding to requirements.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "Why isn't seaborn in here ? Because it wasn't imported! Check the requirements.txt file first (seaborn is in there).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using Bokeh\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are familiar and want to produce content for the app, go for it! \n",
